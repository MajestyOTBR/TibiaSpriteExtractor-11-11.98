# TibiaSpriteExtractor-11-11.98
extracts tibia sheets from the latest tibia client , with licence do wtf u want but leave credit :)
this also adds the extracted bmp to selected spr file, in wich u can downgrade/upgrade or just keep the version as it was ^^

added a client.xml file so u can add your own client support ^^ just drop the name there and select it when losding/creating spr file. or if u want to upgrade the file then u choose another client right before creating the spr ^^

credit to ottols for the spr functions <3
